Smart Home automation system using UART Interrupts using HC-05 Bluetooth Module.<br>
This code is written to be run on an LPC2129 Development board which has an on-board ARM7 Processor and UART Peripheral. The board is required to be interfaced with the HC-05 Bluetooth Module using the TxD and RxD pins on the Board. The Bluetooth module can be interfaced with the smartphone using any Serial Bluetooth Terminal App.<br>
For testing this code I have used the following app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=project.bluetoothterminal
